The easiest parts of the tutorial were the later changes to some of the files within the project, such as updating some page names or seeding the database. The most confusing/difficult part was getting everything working dependency-wise. After working through the tutorial once, translating it to a new project wasn't too difficult despite some hiccups. Both the Jekyll framework and the Razor Pages framework function similarly in that both provide a very basic structure with which you can use to create some application/website/etc. without needing to go through too much setup. I am confident now in making more Razor Pages applications, provided I am able to use the tutorial.
