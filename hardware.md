I have noticed something in the consumer electonics world that I find very interesting, as smart devices grow both more compact and powerful. Every device deemed smart is, to a very basic extent, just a larger or smaller computer, though it may not seem so. For example, certain tech-savvy individuals have used the small ipad-sized screen of a samsung smart fridge to link with other smart systems, or always display the weather, or in some cases to play doom. After all, behind that screen is something with a motherboard, some variation of CPU, and probably just under a gig of RAM. It's also running either some variation of linux or Andriod OS. The perfect ingredients for, quite literally, anything you want that smart fridge to do. As the world of consumer electronics becomes more and more 'smart', the opportunities to change how they function, for better or for worse, become more and more boundless.
