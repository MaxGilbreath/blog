The setup leading to this blog was arduous, but undeniably worth it. Almost all parts were new to me, although the struggle only really came up in configuring the blog site itself with Jekyll. There were some issues with dependencies that needed to be installed separately, along with configuring the files that handle how the site is found through the internet. I still do not quite understand how to use the ruby integration with Jekyll, however I am looking forward to learning more about this to better utilize Jekyll. Currently my goals include the following:

  -Create a custom theme for the blog.
  -Learn more about the ruby language to include more interactive elements.

Links that are useful for now but should be incuded in the blog main page later on:
