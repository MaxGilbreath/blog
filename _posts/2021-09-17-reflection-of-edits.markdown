While I now have some familiarity with editing this blogging site with jekyll, having to navigate to the gem file containing the site layouts and other related information was troublesome. However, this was of my own fault, as I had downloaded ruby and all project-related dependencies to an unrelated folder in my downloads directory. Not just an inconvenient place for such an important collection of dependencies, but also one that will be difficult to fix as everything is currently set up to point to that directory when ruby and its various attributes are invoked. Currently the specifics of ruby and its gem-based system still elude me, but I look forward to both learning more about it and how to manage my own blog site. Unrelated to this point, here are two pictures of my cats Piewhacket (top) and Grimalkin (bottom). I did not name them.
