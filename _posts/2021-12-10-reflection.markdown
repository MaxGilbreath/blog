Overall, I feel that the final project's lesson was how to manage a computer science-based project within a group. What this means is utilizing various applications and software to
coordinate and communicate effectively. Working on a new project in a mostly new language required a breadth of communication issues to be resolved, from finding meeting times
that work for all members as well as resolving conflicts in members working on different versions of the project. I greatly enjoyed the inersection of communicating with my group
in a buisness/ formal sense in order to complete project goals on time, while also getting to know them better as classmates and friends. The final also taught me about how to 
adapt various solutions from other problems to any problem I can currently experiencing, overall serving as a great lesson in problem-solving. I feel as though this final project 
was well-tailored for both this course and for teaching valuable lessons in computer science.
